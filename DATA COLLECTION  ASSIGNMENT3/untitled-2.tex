\subsection {Data analysis}
According to the collected information and data, the leading factors as to why students involve in examination malpractice is the desire to pass exams at all cost which is due to lack of confidence and fear of getting low marks as well as being ill prepared for the examination. Other reasons are the anxiety to get a certificate and high-grade and the emphasis on certificate presentation for a job, Improper guidance and counseling, truancy, absenteeism and laziness attribute to this ill-preparedness for examinations. 
\newline While some students intentionally get indulge in the malpractices; others see themselves in it through ignorance, carelessness or forgetfulness in applying regulations or due to peer pressure. The methods that are often used include writing answers on question papers, copying other students work during the examination entering examination room with phones, lecturers sending prepared answers to students writing on body parts hiring other people to write exams, using programmable calculators.
